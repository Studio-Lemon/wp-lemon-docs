After you're done with setting up your post and added your custom functionality in the controller layer.
You can now use the post object in your templates.

```twig

{% block content %}
	<header class="section">
		<h1>{{ person.get_full_name() }}</h1>
	</header>
	{{ person.content }}
{% endblock %}

```

## Default Timber post methods.

Timber's post objects have a lot of default methods that you can use in your templates. You can find a list of all the default methods in the [Timber Post documentation](https://timber.github.io/docs/reference/post/). Below we give the most commonly used methods.

- `post.link()`: Get the permalink of the post.
- `post.title()`: Get the title of the post.
- `post.content()`: Get the content of the post.
- `post.excerpt()`: Get the excerpt of the post.

```twig
post.excerpt({
    read_more: false,
    words: 15
})
```

- `post.meta('my_field_name')`: Get the value of a custom field.
