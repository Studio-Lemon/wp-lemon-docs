Welcome to version 5.0 of wp-lemon. In this guide we will go over the details to upgrade your current 4.x website to the 5.x.

## Before we get started
Please make sure you have the latest version of your project checked out and have a recent database and media files to check your website locally.

## Upgrade steps
Follow the next steps to upgrade your project to use wp-lemon 4.

### Step 1. Set new major version of wp-lemon, Timber and Bulldozer
Navigate to your composer.json file in the project root and update it as follows.

```json
-    "satispress/wp-lemon": "^4.0",
+    "satispress/wp-lemon": "^5.0",
-    "timber/timber": "^1.x",
+    "timber/timber": "^2.0",
-    "highground/bulldozer": "^3.x",
+    "highground/bulldozer": "^4.0",
```

### Step 2. Update child-theme dependencies
Navigate to your child theme and open package.json and update the following dependencies to at least these versions. 


```json
-  "swiper": "^10.0",
+  "swiper": "^11.0",
```
### Step 3. Run update-parent command
Open a new console in your child theme and run the following command: `yarn run update-parent`

This will update both PHP and node dependencies to their latest versions.

### Step 4. Run production build
Open a new console in your child theme and run the following command: `yarn run production`
This will create a fresh build with the new dependencies. If the build fails, please try to debug the error or open a new ticket.

### Step 5. Read the Timber 2.0 migration guide and update/test your child theme

Since this release is mostly focussed on the Timber 2.0 update, please read the [Timber 2.0 migration guide](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/upgrade-guides/2.0/) and update your child theme accordingly.

## Deploy
Please follow the following guide to deploy the update to the production server. [Deploy update!](/docs/deployment/updates#deploy-update)
