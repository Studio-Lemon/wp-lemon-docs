Once the setup of your new project is complete, you can start developing your theme. This guide will help you get started with the basics of wp-lemon in a order that makes sense to the development workflow.

## Create post types and taxonomies
As a first step it is recommended to create the post types that you will need for your project. This will help you to get a better understanding of the data structure of your project and in a later step, you can link the post types to a custom archive page.

You can read more about creating post types and taxonomies in the [post types guide](/extend/add-models).

You can also deregister existing post types via library/models/modify-post-types.php

## Create menu structure via the customizer

Its recommended to create the menu structure of your project via the customizer. This way you can easily add pages to the menu and preview the output directly.

## Set defaults via the customizer
After that you can set the default values for your project. This includes the archive pages for your post types, setting contact information among other things.

## Create footer
Via template parts in the WordPress admin you can create the footer of your project. The default footer is setup with 3 "widget" blocks which you can use to display text or a menu for example.

## Setup colors, fonts, logos and favicons
Its now time to setup some basic branding for your project. Please read [basic styling](/basics/basic-styling), [how to create fonts](/basics/fonts), [Logo's](/basics/logos) and [favicons](/basics/favicons-manifest) for more information.

## Start creating your blocks
Based on your design, you can figure out what blocks you can use to create the pages of your project. You can use the default set of blocks available in wp-lemon and you can create your own for unique blocks. You can read more about creating blocks in the [blocks guide](/blocks/key-concepts).
