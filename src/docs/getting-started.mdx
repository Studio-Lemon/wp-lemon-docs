This is the getting started guide for WP Lemon. We will go through the requirements and how to get a new project started.

## How to start a new project

1. Create new folder in project directory and name it as the main url of the new project but change the .tld (.nl/.com) to .local or .test
2. Clone the GIT repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Studio-Lemon/wp-lemon-2.git .
```

3. Switch to the development branch.

```bash
git checkout development
```

4. Create a database for your project.
5. Duplicate .env.example to .env in the project root and fill DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, WP_HOME and generate the AUTH KEYS
6. Navigate to `/web/app/themes`, duplicate the `wp-lemon-child-example` folder and rename it accordingly to your project.
7. Open to style.css in the new child theme and change the theme name. Change Author and Author URI to your liking.
8. Open a new terminal, navigate to your new theme and run

```bash
yarn run bootstrap-project
```

This will install composer in root, yarn install --no-dev in the parent theme and yarn install in the new child theme.
If you get prompted for filling in credentials, please contact Erik

7. In your child theme, navigate to `/resources/asset/` and duplicate `config.json.example` to `config.json` and change the `rootToThemePath` and `browserSyncURL`.
8. Now, create a virtual host for your project and choose `/web` as your root
9. Navigate to your development url and do the WordPress setup.
10. Activate the new child theme. This will enable required plugins and set up the theme. You will be prompted with a message that no manifest file was found.
11. Run a first built by running

```bash
yarn run development
```

12. Profit! You now have a new project set up to start developing a new awesome website.

## Webpack commands / start development

To start developing you can run some commands that will compile the assets. You will have to run these commands from your child theme folder.
