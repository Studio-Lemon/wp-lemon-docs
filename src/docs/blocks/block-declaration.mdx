As explained on the Key concepts page, 
Your declaration file (`.json`) is where it all starts as this file handles the registration with WordPress. 
This file is essential because it defines all the necessary metadata for the block, including its name, title, 
description, and various configuration options that determine its behavior within the WordPress editor.

## Anatomy of a block declaration
Although the declaration file is being generated when creating a new block, it's important to understand the structure of this file.
Below you'll find an example of a block declaration file:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Levdbas/acf-json-schema/main/acf-blocks.json",
    "name": "acf/block-slug",
    "title": "Block title", 
    "description": "Block description",
    "category": "wp-lemon-blocks",
    "icon": "Dashicon",
    "keywords": ["keyword", "keyword 2", "keyword 3"],
    "apiVersion": 3,
    "textdomain": "wp-lemon-child",
    "acf": {
        "mode": "preview"
    },
    "supports": {
        "align": ["full"],
        "color": {
            "background": true,
            "text": false
        }
    }
}
```

## Using block supports
The support section defines what features are available to the block. 
For example, you can enable or disable support for alignment options, color settings, custom classes, and more. 
This allows fine-grained control over what functionality the block exposes to users.

When defining this section it's important to think about how much control you want to give to the user.
In most cases you'll want to limit the available options to prevent users from breaking the design of the block.
While in other cases you might want to give users more control over the block's appearance.

Common examples of support properties you might want to use are `align` and `color`. 
This way you can enable or disable alignment options and color settings for the block. This will look something like this:

```json
{
    "supports": {
        "align": ["full"],
        "color": {
            "background": true,
            "text": false
        }
    }
}
```
