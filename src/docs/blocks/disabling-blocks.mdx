title: Disabling blocks
description: Documentation on how to disable blocks.

WordPress blocks are a powerful tool to create content in the WordPress editor. 
However, sometimes you might want to disable certain blocks. There are WordPress core blocks and wp-lemon blocks, and both can be disabled.
It is possible to disable certain blocks, or make a specific allow list of blocks that can be used.


## Wp-lemon blocks
Filtering the blocks is done by using the `wp-lemon/filter/blocks` filter. This filter works as an allow list, 
meaning that only the blocks that are in the array will be allowed.
```php

add_filter(
	'wp-lemon/filter/blocks',
	function ($blocks) {
		return [
			'logo',
			'node-overview',
			'widgets',
			'widget',
		];
	}
);

```

You can also use this accent same hook to create a deny list, by unsetting the blocks you want to disable. 
This means that all blocks are allowed, except the ones that are unset.

```php	

add_filter(
	'wp-lemon/filter/blocks',
		function ($blocks) {
			unset($blocks['price-card']);
			return $blocks;
		}
);

```

## Core blocks
Also for core blocks we've created a hook in wp-lemon. This hook again works as an allow list, specifically for core blocks.

```php	

add_filter('wp-lemon/filter/core-blocks-to-allow',
	function ($blocks) {
		return [
			'core/paragraph',
			'core/list',
			'core/heading',
		];
	}
);

```

To create a deny list for core blocks, you'll have to use another hook:

```php

add_filter(
	'wp-lemon/filter/core-blocks-to-remove',
	function ($blocks) {
		$extra_blocks_to_remove = ['core/list'];
		return array_merge($blocks, $extra_blocks_to_remove);
	}
);

```

To see the full list of hooks we've build for you to use, please take a look at the [filter documentation](/reference/hooks/filters).
