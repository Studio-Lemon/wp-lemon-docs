When creating a new website you'll probably want to add your own fonts as well. You can do this in two ways.

## Using an enqueue hook (external hosting)

The first is to enqueue an external stylesheet by using the `wp_enqueue_scripts` and `enqueue_block_editor_assets` hooks in your child theme.

## Add them to your assets (provide fonts locally).

You might want to host the fonts locally for several reasons.

## Add font-family value to variables

When you've added your font you will now have to add the font variables in your `_variables.scss`. Read [basic styling](/basics/basic-styling) for more information about overwriting variables.

```scss
$base-font: "Lato", sans-serif;
$secondary-font: "Noto Serif", serif;
```
