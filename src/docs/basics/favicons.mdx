WP Lemon comes with a very obvious set of default favicons. This is to force you to create your own. Luckily it is very easy to create your own set. [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) you can create your own set of favicons.

After generating your own set please place them in `/web/app/themes/YOURCHILDTHEME/resources/favicons`.

The following function

```php
WP_Lemon\Controllers\favicon_path()
```

checks if `site.webmanifest` is present in your new favicon folder. If so, your new generated files will be loaded instead of the default ones provided by the parent theme.
