description:  Set some defaults for your WordPress installation

We tried to strike a good balance between managing settings via the customizer and WordPress filters.
The settings that you can manage via the customizer are:

- Site title and description (Native WordPress)
- Create menus (Native WordPress)
- Archive pages
- social links
- Contact information
- 404 page settings
- analytics and tracking codes
- Add additional important pages like terms of service and contact page

It is recommended to create your menu structure, add your custom post types and after that set your archive pages.
