description: How to overwrite the default logo's
---

WP Lemon comes with default logo's that you can overwrite. You can create a `images/logo.svg` and a `images/logo-footer.svg` file in `resources/images/`. After running one of the webpack commands your new files will be loaded.

If you want to use other formats or you want to inject a svg file directly, please see [global context](/extend/add-context)
