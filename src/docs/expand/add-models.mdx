In the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) the M stands for Model. As Wikipedia puts it:

> The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It  directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

Models live in the `library/models` folder of your child theme. You can generate them by using generatewp

| Type             | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Post type       | create a file named cpt-YOURPOSTTYPE.PHP and add generate code via [this website](https://generatewp.com/post-type/)                                                      |
| Taxonomy     | create a file named tax-YOURTAXONOMY.PHP add generate code via [this website](https://generatewp.com/taxonomy/) |

Don't forget to add the right namespace and namespace the action.

```php 
namespace WP_Lemon\Child\Models;
...
...
add_action('init', __NAMESPACE__ . '\\cpt_example', 0);
```

## Post type custom page archives
We've added a functionality so that pages can be labeled as archive pages for single-posts of any post type as long as you add support for it in your post type declaration.


### Add support in post type
Add the maybe_has_archive_page line to your model and change the `get_theme_mod()` accordingly to your post type name as seen on the last line of the example.

```php title=library/models/your-cpt.php highlight={6}
namespace WP_Lemon\Child\Models;

    // Add
    $args = [
        ...
        'maybe_has_archive_page' => get_theme_mod('archive_mycustomposttype') ? get_theme_mod('archive_mycustomposttype') : true,
    ];

    register_post_type('mycustomposttype', $args);
```

### Select page as archive page in the customizer.
You can now navigate to the customizer > wp-lemon > Archives and posttypes

Your new post type will show up in a new dropdown field. Please select or create a page that serves as the archive for your new post type.
