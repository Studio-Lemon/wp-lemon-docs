description: Learn how to overwrite twig files from the parent theme.

If a theme requires a completely new variant of an existing header or block for example and there are no actions/filters available to create the changes needed we have a last resort.

You can overwrite twig files in your child theme by creating exactly the same file in the same location as the parent theme and make changes accordingly. Once again, use this as a last resort since changes to the parent file will not be reflected in your child theme and thus you have to double check after each update that your overwritten files are still displayed as intended.

If you find yourself in the situation overwriting files a lot, please contact us and explain your situation. We might just ad d a new action or filter for you if we can relate in your use-case.
