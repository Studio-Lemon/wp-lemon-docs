You might be in the situation where you need to overwrite some css. Your scss will be added to the app.css file **after** the css of the parent theme and thus will be overrule earlier styles with the same selector(s).

You can make tiny changes inside your `_styleguide.scss` file but if you have to do larger changes it is better to create a scss partial in correct folder. See example.

**Example**

```scss title=resources/styles/04-components/_card-overwrites.scss
.crd--job {

	.job-meta {
		margin-top: 10px;
		font-size: 0.6em;
	}
}

.crd {

	a.crd__inner {
		transition: all 0.3s ease;

		& * {
			color: inherit;
			transition: all 0s ease;
		}

		&:hover {
			color: $white;
			background-color: $color-azure-radiance;
		}
	}

	&__header {

		span {
			font-size: 16px;
		}
	}
}

```
