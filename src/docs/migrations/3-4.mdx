Welcome to version 4.0 of wp-lemon. In this guide we will go over the details to upgrade your current 3.x website to the 4.x.

## Before we get started
Please make sure you have the latest version of your project checked out and have a recent database and media files to check your website locally.

## Upgrade steps
Follow the next steps to upgrade your project to use wp-lemon 4.

### Step 1. Set new major version of wp-lemon
Navigate to your composer.json file in the project root and update it as follows.

```json
-    "satispress/wp-lemon": "^3.0",
+    "satispress/wp-lemon": "^4.0",
```

### Step 2. Update child-theme dependencies
Navigate to your child theme and open package.json and update the following dependencies to at least these versions. 

> ⚠️
> Make sure not to delete/overwrite extra dependencies that you may have included.

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@wordpress/browserslist-config": "^5.17",
    "basebuilder-config": "^3.3.7",
    "prettier": "^2.8",
    "prettier-plugin-twig-melody": "^0.4.6",
    "stylelint": "^15.6",
    "stylelint-basebuilder": "^2.3"
},
"dependencies": {
    "@popperjs/core": "^2.11.8",
    "aos": "^3.0.0-beta.6",
    "bootstrap": "^5.3",
    "lodash.throttle": "^4.1.1",
    "swiper": "^10.0",
    "vanilla-lazyload": "17.8"
}
```
### Step 3. Move backend() function outside of domReady in editor.js
move backend() function outside of domReady

```js
import domReady from '@wordpress/dom-ready';
import backend from 'parentThemeScripts/components/functions-backend';

++ backend();
domReady(() => {
    acf.addAction('render_block_preview', function (el, block) {
        -- backend();
    });
});

```

### Step 4. Run update-parent command
Open a new console in your child theme and run the following command: `yarn run update-parent`

This will update both PHP and node dependencies to their latest versions.

### Step 5. Run production build
Open a new console in your child theme and run the following command: `yarn run production`
This will create a fresh build with the new dependencies. If the build fails, please try to debug the error or open a new ticket.
