Welcome to version 3.0 of wp-lemon. In this guide we will go over the details to upgrade your current 2.x website to the 3.x version.

## Before we get started
Please make sure you have the latest version of your project checked out and have a recent database and media files to check your website locally.

## Upgrade steps
Follow the next steps to upgrade your project to the 3.x branch.

### Step 1. Set new major version of wp-lemon
Navigate to your composer.json file in the project root and update it as follows.

```json
-    "satispress/wp-lemon": "^2.0",
+    "satispress/wp-lemon": "^3.0",
```

### Step 2. Update child-theme dependencies
Navigate to your child theme and open package.json and update the following dependencies to at least these versions. 

> ⚠️
> Make sure not to delete/overwrite extra dependencies that you may have included.

```json
    "devDependencies": {
        "@wordpress/browserslist-config": "^4.1.0",
        "basebuilder-config": "^2.3.0",
        "prettier": "^2.5",
        "prettier-plugin-twig-melody": "^0.4.6"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "@popperjs/core": "^2.11.0",
        "aos": "^3.0.0-beta.6",
        "bootstrap": "^5.1",
        "lodash.throttle": "^4.1.1",
        "swiper": "^7.3",
        "vanilla-lazyload": "17.5"
    }
```

### Step 3. Update child-theme script
Navigate to your child theme and open package.json and replace the scripts section with the following code.

```json
    "scripts": {
        "bootstrap-project": "composer install --working-dir=../../../../ && yarn install",
        "composer-deploy": "composer install --working-dir=../../../../ --no-dev --optimize-autoloader",
        "composer-update": "composer update --working-dir=../../../../",
        "update-parent": "composer update --working-dir=../../../../ && yarn install",
        "dev": "basebuilder-config development",
        "development": "basebuilder-config development",
        "watch": "basebuilder-config watch",
        "production": "basebuilder-config production",
        "lint": "yarn run -s lint:scripts && npm run -s lint:styles",
        "lint:styles": "stylelint \"resources/assets/styles/**/*.scss\"",
        "lint:scripts": "eslint resources/assets/scripts",
        "lint:twig": "yarn run prettier --write \"resources/views/**/*.twig\""
    },
```

### Step 4. Remove iconfont and lato folders
Navigate to `resources/assets/fonts` and remove the `iconfont` and `lato` folders.  

### Step 5. import new dependencies in app.js
Navigate to resources/assets/scripts/app.js and locate the bootstrap imports at te top. Remove the util import and add the offcanvas import as shown in this code example.

```js
- import 'bootstrap/js/dist/util';
  import 'bootstrap/js/dist/button';
  import 'bootstrap/js/dist/collapse';
+ import 'bootstrap/js/dist/offcanvas';
```


### Step 6. Run update-parent command
Open a new console in your child theme and run the following command: `yarn run update-parent`

This will update both PHP and node dependencies to their latest versions.

### Step 7. Run production build
Open a new console in your child theme and run the following command: `yarn run production`
This will create a fresh build with the new dependencies. If the build fails, please try to debug the error or open a new ticket.

### Step 8. Check child theme on hooks and actions usage.
The naming of filters got a massive overhaul. Please double check our [filters chapter](/expand/hooks#filters-inside-wp-lemon) and triple-check if your filters need to be updated and work as intended.

## Visual/Code check
Since this is a new major version please check the build locally with the latest database and media files. Check for any visual differences. If you find a major difference please try to debug or open a ticket.

If you've written custom code based on Swiper or Bootstrap, for example created a new block or a slider that involves on of these libraries, please check out the following migration guides.

- Please check custom bootstrap code against https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/migration/
- Please update custom Swipers against https://swiperjs.com/migration-guide

## Deploy
Please follow the following guide to deploy the update to the production server. [Deploy update!](/deployment/updates#deploy-update)
