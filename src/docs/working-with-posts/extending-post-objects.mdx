In wp-lemon it's possible to extend the post objects to add functionality if needed.
This should be done by navigating to the `/library/controllers/` directory.
Here you can create a new file that extends the `Post` class. This will look something like this:
    
```php

<?php

/**
 * Setup an extended post query class.
 * Used for post_type_name
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage WP_Lemon\Child
 */

namespace WP_Lemon\Child\Classes;

use Timber\Post;
use Timber\Timber;

class post_type_name extends Post
{
   private mixed $_example = null;

   public function get_example(): array|null
   {
      if (!is_null($this->_example)) {
         return $this->_example;
      }

      return $this->_example;
   }
}

```

After you've created this file you'll need to add it to the classmap, this needs to be done so that Timber knows where to find the new class.
You should do this inside the `/library` directory. 
In essence you could place it anywhere like in the `hooks.php` file but we prever to place it in the `child-setup.php` file since it's part of the setup process.
This will look something like this:

```php

add_filter(
	'timber/post/classmap',
	function ($classmap) {
		$custom_classmap = [
			'person'         => Person::class,
			'publication'    => Publication::class,
			'project'        => Project::class,
			'lectorate'      => Lectorate::class,
			'news'           => News::class,
			'post-education' => PostEduction::class,
			'education'      => Education::class,
		];

		return array_merge($classmap, $custom_classmap);
	}
);

```

Below you can see a couple simple examples that you could use in your extended post object, 
and also how you can then use it in your front-end. 

### Example 1
Below you'll find a simple example of a function that calculates the reading time of a post.

```php

/**
 * Calculate the reading time of the post.
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function reading_time(): string
{
	$words_per_minute = 228;

	$words = str_word_count(wp_strip_all_tags($this->content()));

	if ($words / $words_per_minute < 1) {
		return __('< 1 minute', 'wp-lemon-child');
	}

	$minutes = round($words / $words_per_minute);

	/* translators: %s: Time duration in minute or minutes. */
	return sprintf(_n('%s minute', '%s minutes', $minutes, 'wp-lemon-child'), (int) $minutes);
}

```

This newly created function can be used in your single page for example like this:

```html

{% block content %}
	<header class="section">
		<div class="entry__header-top">
			<div class="readingtime">
				<i class="icon-clock-o"></i>
				{{ post.reading_time }}
			</div>
		</div>
		<h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
	</header>
	{{ post.content }}
{% endblock %}

```

### Example 2
In this example the name of a person needed to be formatted in a certain way, ofc we could've also done it in the front-end 
but we believe that it's best to let the back-end handle most of the logic.

```php	

	/**
	 * Fetch the full name of the person, including title.
	 *
	 * @return string
	 */
	public function get_full_name(): string
	{
		if (!is_null($this->_full_name)) {
			return $this->_full_name;
		}
		$name = null;

		$names_group = $this->meta('names');

		$name .= $names_group['title'] ? $names_group['title'] . ' ' : '';
		$name .= $names_group['first_name'] ? $names_group['first_name'] . ' ' : '';
		$name .= $names_group['last_name'] ? $names_group['last_name'] : '';

		$this->_full_name = $name;

		return $this->_full_name;
	}

```

## Wp-lemon queries
In wp-lemon we've added a set of predefined queries that you can use to fetch posts. You could use these for example in your block context.
For more documentation on how to use them within your block context take a look at the [block context documentation](/blocks/block-controller).
Below you can find a list of all the queries that are available in wp-lemon.
