You can now use the post object in your templates. 
In de post object extend file you can find an example of a function that returns the full name of a person.
In below example you can see how you could use this function in your template.

```twig

{% block content %}
	<header class="section">
		<h1>{{ person.get_full_name }}</h1>
	</header>
	{{ person.content }}
{% endblock %}

```
