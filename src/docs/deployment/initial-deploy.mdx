## Create/upload database

After deploying the files you can make a full export of the database on your local or staging environment using the migrate db pro plugin. Make sure that you search/replace the correct url to ensure proper url redirects throughout the website. Create a database and matching mysql user/password. Upload the database via phpmyadmin or wp cli with the `wp db import export-db-name.sql`.

## Update .env file in root.

In your .env file update:

- DB_NAME
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- WP_ENV. Make sure to set it to staging or production accordingly.
- WP_HOME
- New set of salts

## Checks

The website should now be up and running. Make sure to check the following:

- Child theme contains a dist folder with production build.
- Website is added to maintenance dashboard.
- Make sure mail functionality is working as expected.
- SEO plugins are setup and active.
- Google search console is activated.
- New websites added by submitting it to the Google index.
