Sometimes you want to extend the capabilities of wp-lemon. Sometimes custom blocks are required.

## Register block

in you custom theme in `library/blocks` you'll find `_example.php`. What you want to do is duplicate this file. After that you want to overwrite the
`Example_Block` class and activate the class on the bottom of this file by uncommenting the class call. After that you can update the name, title, icon data. This file automatically gets loaded. See all the variables you can add to the `$block` array over here at the [ACF docs](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/acf_register_block_type/).

```php title=library/blocks/_example.php lineNumbers=true
<?php

namespace WP_Lemon\Child\Blocks;

use HighGround\Bulldozer\BlockRenderer;

/**
* Register a new ACF Block.
*
* The array is passed to the acf_register_block_type() function that registers the block with ACF.
*
* @link https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/acf_register_block_type/
* @return array
*/
class Example_Block extends BlockRenderer
{
   public function block_register(): array
   {
      $block = [
         'name' => 'example', // searches for resources/views/blocks/example.twig
         'title' => __('Example name', 'wp-lemon'),
         'description' => __('Example description', 'wp-lemon'),
         'category' => 'wp-lemon-blocks', // default custom category or add new ones.
         'icon' => 'desktop', // regular dashicons without the 'dashicon-' prefix
         'keywords' => ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3'], // keywords to search blocks for.
         'supports' => [
            'align' => false
         ],
        //'show_disable_button' => true, // This adds a button to disable the block.
        //'deprecated' => array( // This adds a deprecation message inside the block.
        //   'since' => '2.1', // since when is the block deprecated
        //   'use' => 'test', // name of block to use instead of this block.
        //),
      ];
      return $block;
   }

   /**
    * Extend the base context of our block.
    * With this function we can add for example a query or
    * other custom content.
    *
    * @param array   $context    Holds the current block data that you'll expand in this method.
    * @return array  $context    Returns the array with the extra content that merges into the original block context.
    */
   public function block_context($context): array
   {

      return $context;
   }

   /**
    * Register fields via acfbuilder
    *
    * @link https://github.com/StoutLogic/acf-builder
    * @return object
    */
   public function add_fields(): object
   {
      return $this->registered_fields;
   }
}

/**
 * Enable the class
 */
//new Example_Block();


```

## Create twig file

After registering the block you need to create a twig file to render the view of the block. in `resources/views/blocks/` you will find `example.twig`. You want to duplicate this file and make it have the same name as set in your php file.

## Test block

You can now add the block to a page and see if it works. Common reasons why the block doesn't work:

- You forgot to uncomment the block register call in your PHP file.
- You didn't change the classnames on all places.
- There is no matching twig file.

Once verified that the block is working you can continue developing your new block.

## Develop the new block

Every block is different but we will give some common examples on how to expand your block.

### Block that displays an x amount of (custom)posts

Take a look at the `news-recent.php` block in the parent theme. You will find a method block_context().
When going through these lines you will find several notable things.

```php lineNumbers=true
 public function block_context($context): array
   {
      $amount = get_field('amount') ? get_field('amount') : 3;
      $items = latest_items_query('news', $amount);
      $context['items'] = $items;
      $context['card_type'] = 'news';
      $context['holder_classes'] = 'col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4';
      $message = __("You haven't added any news yet, so this block will be empty.", "wp-lemon");

      if ($items->found_posts == 0) {
         parent::add_notification($message, 'warning');
      }

      return $context;
   }
```

- wp-lemon comes with a set of predefined queries. Here we use latest_items_query() to get the lastest posts of a specific posttype
- We have a card_type variable that defines what card type will be loaded.
- We have a add_notification method that will setup a notification inside the block when previewed in the backend.

### Block that displays a post archive with load more button

Take a look at the `news-overview.php` block in the parent theme. You will again find a method block_context() that will query the data from the database and add it to the block context.

```php lineNumbers=true
   public function block_context($context): array
   {
      $items = archive_query('news', 6); // query the news posttype
      $context['items'] = $items;
      $context['nav'] = true; // show nav
      $context['count'] = get_total_posts('news', count($items)); // get a count array that feeds information to the postholder.
      $context['post_type'] = 'news'; // sets post type for the ajax calls.
      $context['card_type'] = 'news'; // sets the twig partial to render the actual posts in the loop.
      $context['holder_classes'] = 'col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4'; // holder classes around the cards in the loop.

      if (isset($this->fields['show_filter']) && $this->fields['show_filter'] == true) {
         $context['show_filter'] = true;
         $context['terms'] = get_terms('category', array('hide_empty' => true));
      }

      // add notification when no posts are found.
      if ($items->found_posts == 0) {
         parent::add_notification(__('You haven\'t added any news yet, so this block will be empty.', 'wp-lemon'), 'warning');
      }

      return $context;
   }
```

The linked `blocks/news-overview.twig` file will include `components/archive-loop.twig` that will display the initial posts and setup everything for receiving new posts via an ajax call.

When reusing above code make sure to:

- set the post type correctly
- create a new card twig file
- include the `components/archive-loop.twig` inside your twig file that is linked to your block.
- Update the notice to inform the administrator/editors of the website when no posts are found of the posttype you want to query.
- include the right functions in your file like so

```php lineNumbers=true
namespace WP_Lemon\Child\Blocks;

use HighGround\Bulldozer\BlockRenderer;

++ use function WP_Lemon\Controllers\archive_query;
++ use function WP_Lemon\Controllers\get_total_posts;
```

### Block with custom assets

You might want to add a specific asset to the blocks context as it is only used by this specific block. You can use the `asset()` helper function for that.

```php lineNumbers=true
	public function block_context($context): array
	{
      // Check if shape exists.
      if(true == asset('images/banner.png')->exists()){
            // get URL to image/shape
            $context['banner_uri'] = asset('images/banner.png')->uri();
      }

      // get contents of the svg to use directly in to your block.
      $context['sphere'] = asset('images/sphere.svg')->contents();

      return $context;
	}
```


### Block with custom acf fields
Blocks can be added in two ways. You can add them by using the administrative interface of ACF. Fields created this way get saved to json and stored in `resources/acf-json`. These fields are thus added to version control.

For a more rigid approach of adding fields you can use the `add_fields()` method.
Here we see a field being added to our already registered group. Fields are added via a pretty straightforward using the OOP method of [ACF Builder](https://github.com/StoutLogic/acf-builder). You can read the docs on how to add [fields](https://github.com/StoutLogic/acf-builder/wiki/fields) and see the per field type [examples](https://github.com/StoutLogic/acf-builder/wiki/field-types).
```php lineNumbers=true
	public function add_fields(): object
	{

		$this->registered_fields
			->addImage('image', [
				'label' => __('Image', 'wp-lemon'),
				'instructions' => '',
				'required' => 1,
				'return_format' => 'id',
				'preview_size' => 'thumbnail',
				'library' => 'all',
			]);

		return $this->registered_fields;
	}
```
### Block that needs conditional modifier classes

You might want to add conditional classes based on a field setting. This is where `$this->add_modifier_class('yourmodifier');` comes in.
This method adds a BEM modifier class to your block. An example:

```php lineNumbers=true
	public function block_context($context): array
	{
    
		if (isset($this->fields['show_pagination']) && true == $this->fields['show_pagination']) {
            $context['show_pagination'] = true;
            $this->add_modifier_class('has-pagination');
		}
    
		return $context;
	}
```

will result in

```html lineNumbers=true
<div class="acf-block slider slider--has-pagination" id="block_5f8ffdc0349e1">
...
</div>
```

## Major changes to blocks
Major changes to the way you register blocks will be reported down here.

### 2.6
Blocks will now require the `add_fields()` method in each block. See [Block with custom acf fields](#block-with-custom-acf-fields) on how to use this method.
