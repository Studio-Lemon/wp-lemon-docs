title: Add global context
description: Learn how to add global context the wp-lemon way.

The context is one of the most important concepts to understand in wp-lemon. Think of the context as the set of variables that are passed to your Twig template, whether this is a template, component or even a block.

By default wp-lemon prepares and adds quite a few element to the global context:


|Key      |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|env      | string  | Holds the environment version: development, staging or production      |
|logo     | array   | By default holds header and footer logos and their uri's, width and height. |
|pages    | array   | Holds the important pages in wp-lemon as well as the archive pages that can be set via the customizer. Also holds the special pages you define yourself. [Lean more about special pages](/extend/special-pages). |
|socials  | array   | Returns all the socials links set in the customizer and their labels, names, url and icons.
|contact  | array   | Returns phonenumer and whatsapp number in a variety of formats. As well as the e-mail address.
|nav     |  array   | Returns primary, footer, multilanguage menus. As well as nav.back on single pages to return to the archive page.
|google_api_key     | string      | Google api key
|contact_buttons     | array        | Context for floating buttons on the bottom left of the page.
|child_theme_author     | array      | returns name and url of the child theme author set in style.css

There are two ways you can alter the context:

1. by overriding parent methods inside your `WP_Lemon_Child_Site` class.
1. Adding additional methods to your `WP_Lemon_Child_Site` class and adding them to `WP_Lemon_Child_Site::extend_site_information()`

## Overriding parent methods inside your WP_Lemon_Child_Site class.
In the example below we add the get_navs method to the child class, call the parent method so we have that context as well, and then expanding the property. In this example you could use `nav.primary` `nav.secondary` to get the new nav menus.

```php
	protected static function get_navs(): array
	{
		parent::get_navs();

		static::$menus['primary'] = wp_nav_menu(
			[
				'echo'           => false,
				'theme_location' => 'primary_navigation',
				'menu_class'     => 'navbar-nav',
				'depth'          => 1,
				'container'      => false,
			]
		);

		static::$menus['secondary'] = wp_nav_menu(
			[
				'echo'           => false,
				'theme_location' => 'secondary_navigation',
				'menu_class'     => 'navbar-nav',
				'depth'          => 1,
				'container'      => false,
			]
		);

		return static::$menus;
	}
```

## Adding additional methods to your WP_Lemon_Child_Site class
In the following example we will extend the global context to add a 'label' to use in templates that holds the current page title or title of the archive page for single pages.

We first create our method builds the context and returns it.
```php
	public function add_label_context()
	{
		$label = false;
		// if is front page, return
		if (is_front_page()) {
			return false;
		}

		if (is_page()) {
			$label = get_the_title();
		} else if (self::is_post_type(['job', 'news', 'case'])) {
			$label = WP_Lemon_Child_Site::get_archive_page();
			$label = $label['title'];
		}

		return $label;
	}
```
After that we add it to our extend_site_information method under a convenient key.

```php

	protected function extend_site_information(): array
	{
		return [
			++ 'nav_label' => $this->add_label_context(),
		];
	}
```

We can now use it inside twig files like this:

```twig
{% if nav_label %}
    <div class="nav-label">
        <span>{{ nav_label }}</span>
    </div>
{% endif %}
```
