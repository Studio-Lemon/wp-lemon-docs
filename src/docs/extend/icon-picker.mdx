description: How to use an icon-picker in wp-lemon
---

When building a website using icons in your design is common. In wp-lemon you can easily add an icon-picker. 
When incorporating the icon-picker you and/or your client can easily select icons and use them in the website. 
Now how do we go about doing this?

## Installation and set-up
### Install & activate icon plugin
First, you'll need to install and activate the the ACF icon picker plugin.
You can do this by running `composer require smithfield-studio/acf-svg-icon-picker` in the root directory.
Once that is finished, navigate to the plugin list in WP Admin. Here, you'll find the plugin "Advanced Custom Fields: Icon Picker". 
Once you find it, activate it.

### Create folder and add your icons
We want to keep all our icons in one place, therefore you can create a new folder in the `resources` directory. 
We'll call this new folder: `icons`.
In this new icons folder you can add all your svg icons.

### Optimize your svg's
Even though your icons will work fine this way, we strongly advice you to optimize your svg's. 
We prefer using only outlines in our svg's, instead of for example paths. 
We found that only using outlines adds consistency and the icons scale better and colors can be changed easily.
Additionally, it will be easier to style your icons later on. 

A popular tool to convert your svg's with is Adobe Illustrator, but you can use whichever tool works best for you!

### Remove colors
You'll also want to remove all inline colors in your svg's. To stay consistent and use best practices we 
want to do all the styling in one place so it will be easier to maintain the code.

## Using your icons 
### Icon field
You can add the icon picker to your fieldgroup by adding the following code to your fieldgroup.

``` php
$my_existing_fieldgroup
->addField(
	'icon', // field name,
	'svg_icon_picker', // field type, do not change
	[
		'label'               => _x('Icon', 'Block field label', 'wp-lemon-child'),
		'wpml_cf_preferences' => 1,
	]
);

```

With this field added to the fieldgroup you'll now find the icon picker in your WordPress editor.

### Placing your icons 
If you want to use your icons in your twig file you can do so by using our build in function `get_svg_icon('icon-name')`.

Please note that the icon field will return a list of icons. 
To use it in your Twig file, you'll need to loop through it as follows:

``` php

{% for item in fields.icons %}
	<div class="icons">
		<div class="icons__icon">{{ get_svg_icon(item.icon) }}</div>
	</div>
{% endfor %}


```
You can also place your icons in PHP using the function `WP_Lemon\API\get_svg_icon('icon-name')`.

We recommend the PHP function when you are dealing with a big site where you want to access the icons in multiple places.
You can prepare the icon field in a custom method and then use the icons in multiple places.

```php
<?php

/**
 * Setup an extended post query class.
 * Used for Service
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage WP_Lemon\Child
 */

namespace WP_Lemon\Child\Classes;

use Timber\Post;

use function WP_Lemon\API\get_svg_icon;

class Service extends Post
{
   private mixed $_icon = null;

   public function get_service_icon(): array|null
   {
      if (!is_null($this->_icon)) {
         return $this->_icon;
      }

      $icon = $this->meta('icon');

      return get_svg_icon($icon);
   }
}
```
And then use in your Twig file like this:

```html
{% for service in services %}
	<div class="service">
		<div class="service__icon">{{ service.get_service_icon() }}</div>
	</div>
{% endfor %}
```
