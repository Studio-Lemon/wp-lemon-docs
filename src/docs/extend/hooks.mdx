description: How to use actions and filters in wp-lemon
---

Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code at specific, pre-defined spots. You can 'hook' into them to modify a set piece of code. Hooks come in the form of **actions** and **filters**.

**Actions**

> Actions allow you to add data or change how WordPress operates. Actions will run at a specific point in the execution of WordPress Core, plugins, and themes. Callback functions for Actions can perform some kind of a task, like echoing output to the user or inserting something into the database. Callback functions for an Action do not return anything back to the calling Action hook.

We use actions in wp-lemon throughout the twig files to add new data on specific spots _without_ overwriting the complete twig file. This means you can upgrade your child themes more easily in the future.

**Filters**

> Filters give you the ability to change data during the execution of WordPress Core, plugins, and themes. Callback functions for Filters will accept a variable, modify it, and return it. They are meant to work in an isolated manner, and should never have side effects such as affecting global variables and output. Filters expect to have something returned back to them.

We use filters in wp-lemon to change specific output that is already baked into the templates. It serves the same purpose as actions are used on a smaller scale, like changing an icon inside a card for example.

## Actions inside blocks

Hooks are in the correct order.

| Action hook                                                   | Description                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| wp-lemon/action/block/{{slug}}/before                         | Add elements inside a block, before the actual block |
| wp-lemon/action/block/{{slug}}/after                          | Add elements inside a block, after the actual block  |
| wp-lemon/action/block/node-overview/{{card_type}}/loop/before | Add elements before the loop                         |
| wp-lemon/action/block/node-overview/{{card_type}}/loop/after  | Add elements after the loop                          |
