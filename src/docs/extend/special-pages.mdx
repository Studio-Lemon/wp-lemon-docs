## What are special pages?
In our website we can define special pages via the Customizer. But what would you classify as a special page? 
As it's in the name we use this method for pages that are 'special', or crucial for the website. 
Good examples of pages that are commonly defined as 'special pages' 
within a website are custom registration pages, crucial forms or landing pages that are cornerstone content for a brand/website.
in case of a e-commerce site the special page could be the check-out page.

## Why use special pages?
Links are sensitive to error and there could be a dozen of reasons that could make a link break.
By marking a page a special page we create a link we can acces globally in the backend. 
This will make the link easier and safer to use.


## Creating your own special page
To create your own special page you'll firstly to register it the `hooks.php` file like so:

```php
/**
 * Add special pages
 *
 * @see 
 * @param [type] $pages
 * @return array updated array with new registered special pages.
 */
function special_pages($pages)
{
   $pages['open_application'] = esc_html__('Open application', 'wp-lemon-child');
   $pages['bank_page']        = esc_html__('Bank page', 'wp-lemon-child');

   return $pages;
}
add_filter('wp-lemon/filter/special-pages', __NAMESPACE__ . '\\special_pages');
```

After you've done this you can navigate to your Customizer in your cms. 
Under special pages you'll now find drop down menu's where you can select your special pages. 
Using the code example above it will look like this:

## Using special pages in your code base
Now you're all set up you can start using it in your website. The most common way to use it is in your twig file.
Again elaborating on the examples above you can do this like so:

```twig
 <a href="{{ pages.open_application.link }}" class="theme-button">
   Apply here
</a>
```

I you want to use it in you controller layer for any reason you can use it like this in you php files:

```php
$pages = WP_Lemon_Site::get_site_information('pages');
$special_page = $pages['my_special_page'];
```
