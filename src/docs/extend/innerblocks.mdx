description: How to use InnerBlocks in wp-lemon
---


By using `InnerBlocks`, you can nest blocks within other blocks.
This allows you to create more complex and flexible layouts by placing blocks inside parent blocks.

> **Note:**
> A single block can only contain one `InnerBlocks` component.

## Building your template
When using `InnerBlocks` it's common to create a template for the `InnerBlocks`. 
This will prefill the InnerBlocks component when inserted and will make it easier to use for you and your clients. 
In wp-lemon we do this inside the `block_context`. 

``` php


	public function block_context($context): array
	{
		$template = [
			[
				'core/heading',
				[
					'placeholder' => __('Add a title', 'wp-lemon'),
					'level'       => 3,
				],
			],
			[
				'core/paragraph',
				[
					'placeholder' => __('Add some text', 'wp-lemon'),
				],
			],
		];

		$args = [
			'InnerBlocks' => self::create_inner_blocks(false, $template),
		];

		return array_merge($context, $args);
	}

```
In the example above we've used a heading and a paragraph block, 
ofcourse you can add other core blocks or even wp-lemon blocks. You can do this like so:

``` php

	$template = [
		['acf/content-card'],
];

```

## Template properties 
By adding extra parameters in the `create_inner_blocks` function we can add some extra functionality. 
In the list below you can see each parameter with it's functionality in the right order.

| Parameter     | Function     |
|--------------|--------------|
| $allowed_blocks | This parameter allows you to make a selection of blocks that are allowed in the innerblocks |
| $template | This parameter refers to your innerblocks template  |
| $classes | This parameter can be used to give custom classnames to your innerblocks container |
| $orientation | ???? |
| $templatelock | This parameter gives the ability to lock down the template so no changes can be made |

> **Note:**
> If a parameter is not given it will default to false.


### Allowed blocks
The `$allowed_blocks` parameter allows you to make a selection of blocks that are allowed in the innerblocks. 
We used the `card-grid` block from wp-lemon as an example. 
In this case the we only wanted to allow specific cards we've made. 
We did this like so:
 
``` php
	public function block_context($context): array
	{
		$template = [
			['acf/content-card'],
		];

		$allowed_blocks = apply_filters('wp-lemon/filter/block/card-grid/allowed-blocks', ['acf/content-card', 'acf/image-card', 'acf/price-card']);

		$args = [
			'InnerBlocks' => self::create_inner_blocks($allowed_blocks, $template),
		];

		return array_merge($context, $args);
	}

```

In the example above we've added it as a parameter in the `create_inner_blocks` function, but the filter that is used could also be used in `libary/hooks.php`.
You can find more documentation on this right [here](/extend/hooks#filters-available-php-block-declarations).

### Classes
To add custom classes to your innerblocks use the third parameter. You can put all the classnames in a string seperated by a space like so:

``` php

$args = [
    'InnerBlocks' => self::create_inner_blocks($template, 'classname classname'),
];


```

### Orientation
Ik heb geen flauw idee wat dit doet

### Templatelock
The fifth and last parameter gives the ability to lock down the template. By default this parameter is false, 
meaning the template will show in your wordpress editor, but you don't have to stick to it. 
By setting it on true you'll lock down the template so no changes can be made. This will look like this:

``` php

$args = [
    'InnerBlocks' => self::create_inner_blocks($template, 'classname classname', false, true),
];


```
