description: How to go about cards in wp-lemon
---

Because cards are a common design element in modern web design, we've made it easy to use them in wp-lemon.

## Different type of cards
Within WP-lemon you'll come across two types of cards. You have the content cards and the post cards.
Content cards are used to display content that is not directly related to a specific post type, such as text, images, or other media.
Post cards, on the other hand, are used to display content that is related to a specific post type, such as blog posts, news articles, or other types of content that are organized into categories or tags.
In wp-lemon, we have a few default cards available for you to use. These cards are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to easily create your own custom cards as well.
In this documentation, we'll explain how to use the default cards, how to create your own custom cards, and how to customize the card settings to fit your needs.

### Default acf-block cards

In wp-lemon, we have a few default content cards available for you to use. These cards are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to easily create your own custom cards as well.
The default content-cards we have available are:
- **Content card**:
The content card is your most basic card. At the very minimum, it will display the title and the content of the post.
Although, you can also add an image and a link to the card.

- **Image-overlay card**:
The image overlay card is a card that displays an image with an overlay. 
This card can be very useful for displaying images with text or other content on top of them.

- **Price card**:
The price card is a card that displays a price. 
This card can be very useful for displaying prices for products or services.

### Default post cards
In wp-lemon, we have a few default post cards available for you to use. These cards are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to easily create your own custom cards as well.
The default post-cards we have available are:

- **Faq card**
- **Job card**
- **News card**
- **Person card**

To give you an idea of what these cards look like, here is an example of a news card without any customizations:

## So how does it work when I want to make my own custom card?
Every default-card extends the `components/cards/crd-wrap.twig` file. 
This file is used to wrap the card and contains the default card structure.
We highly recommend taking a look for yourself to see how the default card is structured 
and get a rough understanding of how it works. Right now we'll give you a quick overview of how the card-wrap is structured and how you can use it while creating your own custom cards.

Within the `components/cards/crd-wrap.twig` file, you can find blocks that are used to display the content of the card.
The following blocks are available in the card-wrap.twig file:

| **Block Name**  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `card_top`       | Content placed at the top of the card. Often used for images or highlights.                                     |
| `card_inner`     | The main content area of the card. Default content is `No content`. Can be overwritten to show card details.    |
| `card_footer`    | The footer area of the card. Contains default functionality for the footer, which can include links or buttons. |

A quick overview of some of the settings we predefined for you that you could use in your custom card:

| **Functionality**            | **Twig Code**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                           |

| **Custom icon**              | `{% set icon = 'custom-icon-class' %}`         | Sets the icon displayed in the footer. Default: `'wp-lemon-icon-arrow-right'`.                                            |
| **Excerpt length**           | `{% set length = 150 %}`                       | Adjusts the excerpt length. Default: `100`. Can be customized per card type via a filter.                                 |

| **Make image clickable**     | `{% set image_link = link_markup %}`           | Makes the image in the card clickable using the default link (`link_markup`).                                             |

| **Add extra holder classes** | `{% set extra_holder_classes = ['holder-class'] %}` | Adds additional CSS classes to the card container (holder).                                                             |


Between content cards and post cards, there is a slight difference in how you would overwrite the default card.

Post cards:
When using the node-overview or the node-latest block, they'll firstly always try to look for a custom card `components/cards/crd-POSTYPENAME.twig`, 
if this file doesn't exist it will fall back to the default card `components/cards/crd-default.twig`. 
Meaning, you can easily create your own custom card like this: `components/cards/crd-POSTYPENAME.twig` for your specific posttype.
