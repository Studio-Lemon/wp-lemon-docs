description: How to go about cards in wp-lemon
---

Because cards are a common design element in modern web design, we've made it easy to use them in wp-lemon. 
We have a few default cards available, but you can easily create your own custom cards as well.

## So how does this work?

When using the node-overview or the node-latest block, they'll always try to look for a custom card `components/cards/crd-POSTYPENAME.twig`, 
if this file doesn't exist it will fall back to the default card `components/cards/crd-default.twig`. 
Meaning, you can easily create your own custom card like this: `components/cards/crd-POSTYPENAAM.twig` for your specific posttype.

Every default-card extends the `components/cards/crd-wrap.twig` file. 
This file is used to wrap the card and contains the default card structure.
We highly recommend taking a look in `resources/views/components/cards/crd-wrap.twig' to see how the default card is structured 
and get a rough understanding of how it works.

# Blocks in `card-wrap.twig`

| **Block Name**  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `card_top`       | Content placed at the top of the card. Often used for images or highlights.                                     |
| `card_inner`     | The main content area of the card. Default content is `No content`. Can be overwritten to show card details.    |
| `card_footer`    | The footer area of the card. Contains default functionality for the footer, which can include links or buttons. |


A quick overview of some of the settings we predefined for you that you could use in your custom card:

| **Excerpt length**           | `{% set length = 150 %}`                       | Adjusts the excerpt length. Default: `100`. Can be customized per card type via a filter.                                 |
