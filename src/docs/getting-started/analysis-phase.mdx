Before starting your project in wp-Lemon, it's essential to begin with an analysis of the design. 
A structured analysis lays the foundation for an efficient, scalable, and well-organized implementation. 
By identifying the recurring elements in the design early on, you can estimate which standardized components you can use and where custom development will be required.


## Implementation in combination with standardized modules
One of wp-Lemon’s strengths lies in its use of reusable components and standardized modules. 
Analyzing your design with this in mind allows you to quickly identify where existing patterns can be applied. 
This includes leveraging pre-built ACF blocks, card components, navigation elements, or layout wrappers. 
It also helps you make more accurate time estimates for different parts of the project.

Identify the unique page types present in the design. 
Are they variations of a single layout, or are there several fundamentally different templates needed? 
This will help you structure your page templates and define global components such as headers, footers, 
and other reusable sections.

Take note of the content blocks used throughout the design. Can these be built using existing WP-Lemon blocks, 
or will custom ones need to be developed? 
Think of hero sections, testimonials, image grids, call-to-actions, and so on.

Zoom in on the smaller design elements, such as buttons, forms, or interactive components. 
These can often be set up as standalone components for consistent use across the site. 
Also consider where hooks might be needed to inject or modify functionality without interfering with 
the core structure.

Finally, identify parts of the design that go beyond visual layout. 
This includes dynamic filters, interactive maps, API integrations, 
or advanced search functionality. These features require extra attention during the analysis phase to 
ensure they are technically feasible and properly scoped.

Once you have completed your analysis, you can go ahead and move on to the setup phase with a clear understanding of
what needs to be built and how to best utilize wp-Lemon's capabilities. This same analysis will also help you communicate
effectively with clients and stakeholders about the project scope and timelines.

Dingen waar ik zelf meteen aan moet denken:
- Hoeveel breedtes zijn er?
- Hoeveel font families?
- Hoeveel Font sizes?
- opzoek gaan naar standaard margins (section)
