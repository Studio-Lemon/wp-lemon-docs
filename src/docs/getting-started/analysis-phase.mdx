Before starting your project in wp-Lemon, it's essential to begin with an analysis of the design. 
A structured analysis lays the foundation for an efficient, scalable, and well-organized implementation. 
By identifying the recurring elements in the design early on, you can estimate which standardized components you can use and where custom development will be required.


## Implementation in combination with standardized modules
One of wp-Lemonâ€™s strengths lies in its use of reusable components and standardized modules. 
Analyzing your design with this in mind allows you to quickly identify where existing patterns can be applied. 
This includes leveraging pre-built ACF blocks, card components, navigation elements, or layout wrappers. 
It also helps you make more accurate time estimates for different parts of the project.





Dingen waar ik zelf meteen aan moet denken:
- Hoeveel breedtes zijn er?
- Hoeveel font families?
- Hoeveel Font sizes?
- opzoek gaan naar standaard margins (section)
