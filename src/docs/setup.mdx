This is the setup guide for wp-lemon. We will go through the requirements and how to get a new project started.

## How to start a new project by using wp-lemon-create

wp-lemon-create is a [npx package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wp-lemon-create) hosted on npm.com to do all the heavy lifting for you. Just run the package, fill in some variables and get yourself a cup of coffee and voilla!

### What you'll need beforehand

- Yarn installed ([How to install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable))
- Git installed ([How to install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
- Composer installed ([How to install](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
- WP-cli installed ([How to install](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/))

The CLI tool will check all the requirements before starting a new project.

### Running the package

To start a new project you'll first want to create a new folder in your projects folder. When using Laravel Valet as your webserver you'll have to add it in the following format: `your-project-name`.

After adding this folder you can open a new terminal inside this folder and run the following command `npx wp-lemon-create` to run the cli-tool. This will automatically download the latest version of this package and starts the installation process. You will now want to follow the instructions given by the cli-tool itself.
